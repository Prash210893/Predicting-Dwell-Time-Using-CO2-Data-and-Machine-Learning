# Predicting-Dwell-Time-Using-CO2-Data-and-Machine-Learning
This project is centered on leveraging carbon dioxide (CO2) sensor data in conjunction with machine
learning methodologies to accurately detect room occupancy and calculate dwell time. The primary
objective is to enhance the monitoring of social health among elderly individuals by providing precise
and efficient occupancy data. To achieve this, the study encompasses comprehensive data
processing, clustering, and predictive modeling. Advanced machine learning algorithms, including
Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Gradient Boosting, are
employed to analyze and interpret the sensor data.
The integration of these technologies is meticulously designed to optimize the accuracy of room
occupancy detection and the calculation of dwell time. The study involves a detailed examination of
the sensor data, followed by a rigorous application of clustering techniques to group similar data
points. Predictive models are then developed and fine-tuned using the mentioned algorithms to
ensure high performance and reliability.
This innovative approach demonstrates a significant potential to improve health monitoring systems
specifically tailored for the elderly. By accurately tracking occupancy and dwell time, caregivers and
healthcare providers can gain valuable insights into the daily activities and social interactions of
elderly individuals. Such information is crucial for assessing their social health and well-being,
allowing for timely interventions and better care management.
Overall, the project showcases the promising application of CO2 sensor data and machine learning in
enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of occupancy detection systems. The successful
implementation of these technologies holds substantial promise for improving social health
monitoring frameworks, thereby contributing to the overall health and quality of life of elderly
populations.
